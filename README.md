# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT

Sentiments Analysis model is built using pre-trained BERT transformers large scale language learnings and analysed smile annotations dataset in PyTorch. The architecture was for multi-class classification. Exploratory data analysis was done with loading tokenizer and encoding data. Data loaders were created to facilitate Batch processing followed up with setting up of Optimizer and Scheduler to control training of model.

The Performance metrics were designed for our model followed by creating a Training loop to control PyTorch fine tuning of BERT acceleration. The pre-trained fine tuned model was loaded and it's performance is evaluated achieving good accuracy.
